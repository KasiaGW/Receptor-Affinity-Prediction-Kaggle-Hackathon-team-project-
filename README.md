# Receptor-Affinity-Prediction-Kaggle-Hackathon-team-project

Kaggle Hackathon team project: predicting receptor-ligand binding affinities using machine learning, with model interpretation using SHAP. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.


# Receptor Affinity Prediction ‚Äì Kaggle Hackathon

Team project conducted as part of the [Kaggle Receptor Affinity Prediction Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/receptor-affinity-prediction-hackathon).

### üìå My Contribution
- Developed model result visualizations (e.g. feature significance analysis, error distribution plots, correlation matrices, model interpretation using SHAP).  
- Participated in data preprocessing and feature engineering.  
- Collaborated on model selection and testing (scikit-learn).  
- Documented results and prepared the final presentation.
